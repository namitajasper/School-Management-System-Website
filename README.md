This project is created for a hypothetical schoolâ€”Pheonix Rising High School. From admissions to an inbuilt quiz portal, this project has several screens and accommodates different users like admins(teachers) and students. The project also has attendance, about sections, and much more about the school. It uses HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Angular JS, and more. This project can be used as a boilerplate to create even more exciting things!
